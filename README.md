# PS-Rackspace

Used for controlling the RackSpace REST API through Powershell. Paths are for a non-reseller plan. 

$domain1 and $domain2 should be changed as needed to reflect the path with the domain name at the end. build_domainURL should also reflect these changes. The build_domainURL is used by every function to select the proper domain via the mandatory -Domain parameter.
